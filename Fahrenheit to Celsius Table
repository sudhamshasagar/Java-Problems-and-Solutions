		W = s.nextInt();
		// F = Start Fahrenheit Value, E = End Value, W = Difference
		while (F<=E) {
			C = ((5 * (F-32))/9);

			F = F + W;
		}

} 


// Let's take F,E,W as a input from the user, The program should run till the end value E from starting value F with a difference of W 
so we have to use While loop for that.
Formula to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius is ((5*(F-32))/9)
While considering the variables take C also along with the F,E,W as we need to declare the variable before using it
In a print function we used a string \t which will work as a tab so that output will be in a table format
Example :
Input
System.out.println("Hello\tWorld!");
Output 
Hello   World!
